Some measures, surrogates, and other tools for symmetric, weighted, complete networks. In particular this includes an implementation of the method proposed in `Ansmann and Lehnertz, Phys. Rev. E 84, 026103 (2011) <http://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.84.026103>`_.

For details about the methods and usage instructions, see the docstrings. All networks are assumed to be given as symmetric NumPy matrices.
