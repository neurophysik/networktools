This is an example for testing the goodness of surrogates for a random network of 24 nodes.
For a stepsize of about 1000, the goodness (chi) assymptotically approaches 1, which indicates that this is a good step size to use for generating surrogates â€“ for networks of this kind and these parameters of the surrogate-generating routine.
